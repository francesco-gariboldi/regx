# Miscellaneous regexes for strings and data manipulation for different languages

This repository aims to have a bunch of regexes for miscellaneous tasks in
psychology. Of course regexes are an highly specific, context-related and
customizable way of working on text and data, here I just try to create some
templates and I share them just in case someone could find them useful.

### Useful for the following tasks (and maybe other tasks):

- Parsing and extraction of:
    - Random and grouping variables from R lme4 styled formulas;
    - bibliographic data from text;
    - data and strings from text;
- Data and strings manipulation
